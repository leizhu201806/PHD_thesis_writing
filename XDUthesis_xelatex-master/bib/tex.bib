This enhancement is attributed to the robustness of the high-transmission channels against perturbations such as sample tilt or wavefront tilt. Our work shows that the high-transmission channels provide an enhanced field of view for memory effect-based imaging through diffusive media.},

	abstract = {Optical imaging through and inside complex samples is a difficult challenge with important applications in many fields. The fundamental problem is that inhomogeneous samples such as biological tissue randomly scatter and diffuse light, preventing the formation of diffraction-limited images. Despite many recent advances, no current method can perform non-invasive imaging in real-time using diffused light. Here, we show that, owing to the ‘memory-effect’ for speckle correlations, a single high-resolution image of the scattered light, captured with a standard camera, encodes sufficient information to image through visually opaque layers and around corners with diffraction-limited resolution. We experimentally demonstrate single-shot imaging through scattering media and around corners using spatially incoherent light and various samples, from white paint to dynamic biological samples. Our single-shot lensless technique is simple, does not require wavefront-shaping nor time-gated or interferometric detection, and is realized here using a camera-phone. It has the potential to enable imaging in currently inaccessible scenarios.},

Tools like scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and spectral domain-optical coherence tomography provide clinicians with remarkably clear pictures of the living retina. Although the anterior optics of the eye permit such non-invasive visualization of the retina and associated pathology, the same optics induce significant aberrations that obviate cellular-resolution imaging in most cases. Adaptive optics (AO) imaging systems use active optical elements to compensate for aberrations in the optical path between the object and the camera. When applied to the human eye, AO allows direct visualization of individual rod and cone photoreceptor cells, retinal pigment epithelium cells, and white blood cells. AO imaging has changed the way vision scientists and ophthalmologists see the retina, helping to clarify our understanding of retinal structure, function, and the etiology of various retinal pathologies. Here, we review some of the advances that were made possible with AO imaging of the human retina and discuss applications and future prospects for clinical imaging.},

	volume = {17},
	issn = {1546-170X},
	abstract = {Progress in understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) has been hindered by our inability to observe cells and extracellular components associated with human coronary atherosclerosis in situ. The current standards for microstructural investigation, histology and electron microscopy are destructive and prone to artifacts. The highest-resolution intracoronary imaging modality, optical coherence tomography (OCT), has a resolution of {\textasciitilde}10 μm, which is too coarse for visualizing most cells. Here we report a new form of OCT, termed micro-optical coherence tomography (μOCT), whose resolution is improved by an order of magnitude. We show that μOCT images of cadaver coronary arteries provide clear pictures of cellular and subcellular features associated with atherogenesis, thrombosis and responses to interventional therapy. These results suggest that μOCT can complement existing diagnostic techniques for investigating atherosclerotic specimens, and that μOCT may eventually become a useful tool for cellular and subcellular characterization of the human coronary wall in vivo.},

	abstract = {Ghost imaging is an unconventional optical imaging technique that reconstructs the shape of an object by combining the measurement of two signals: one that interacted with the object, but without any spatial information; the other containing spatial information, but that never interacted with the object. Here we demonstrate that ghost imaging can be performed without ever knowing the patterns that illuminate the object, by instead using patterns correlated with them, no matter how weakly. As an experimental proof, we reconstruct the image of an object hidden behind a scattering layer using only the reflected light, which never interacts with the object.},

	abstract = {Imaging with optical resolution through turbid media is a long sought-after goal with important applications in deep tissue imaging. Although extensively studied1, this goal was considered impractical until recently. Adaptive-optics techniques2,3, which can correct weak aberrations, are inadequate for turbid samples, where light is scattered to complex speckle patterns with a number of modes greatly exceeding the number of degrees of control4. This conception changed after the demonstration of coherent focusing through turbid media by wavefront-shaping, using spatial light modulators5,6,7. Here, we show that wavefront-shaping enables wide-field imaging through turbid layers with incoherent illumination, and imaging of occluded objects using light scattered from diffuse walls. In contrast to the recently introduced schemes for imaging through turbid media8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15, our technique does not require coherent sources8,9,10,11,12,13,14, interferometric detection10,11,12,13,14, raster-scanning8,9,10,14,15 or off-line reconstruction11,12,13,14,15.

However, this comes at the expense of a limited resolution due to the diffraction limit. Here, we demonstrate a novel method utilizing elastic scattering from disordered nanoparticles to achieve subdiffraction limited imaging. The measured far-field speckle fields can be used to reconstruct the subwavelength details of the target by time reversal, which allows full-field dynamic super-resolution imaging. The fabrication of the scattering superlens is extremely simple and the method has no restrictions on the wavelength of light that is used.},

However, current technologies are complex with multiple alignment-sensitive components and spatial and spectral parameters predetermined by manufacturers. Here, we demonstrate a single-shot multispectral imaging technique that gives flexibility to end users with a very simple optical setup, thanks to spatial correlation and spectral decorrelation of speckle patterns. These seemingly random speckle patterns are point spread functions (PSFs) generated by light from point sources propagating through a strongly scattering medium. The spatial correlation of PSFs allows image recovery with deconvolution techniques, while the spectral decorrelation allows them to play the role of tunable spectral filters in the deconvolution process. Our demonstrations utilizing optical physics of strongly scattering media and computational imaging present a cost-effective approach for multispectral imaging with many advantages.},
