This enhancement is attributed to the robustness of the high-transmission channels against perturbations such as sample tilt or wavefront tilt. Our work shows that the high-transmission channels provide an enhanced field of view for memory effect-based imaging through diffusive media.},

	abstract = {Optical imaging through and inside complex samples is a difficult challenge with important applications in many fields. The fundamental problem is that inhomogeneous samples such as biological tissue randomly scatter and diffuse light, preventing the formation of diffraction-limited images. Despite many recent advances, no current method can perform non-invasive imaging in real-time using diffused light. Here, we show that, owing to the ‘memory-effect’ for speckle correlations, a single high-resolution image of the scattered light, captured with a standard camera, encodes sufficient information to image through visually opaque layers and around corners with diffraction-limited resolution. We experimentally demonstrate single-shot imaging through scattering media and around corners using spatially incoherent light and various samples, from white paint to dynamic biological samples. Our single-shot lensless technique is simple, does not require wavefront-shaping nor time-gated or interferometric detection, and is realized here using a camera-phone. It has the potential to enable imaging in currently inaccessible scenarios.},

Tools like scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and spectral domain-optical coherence tomography provide clinicians with remarkably clear pictures of the living retina. Although the anterior optics of the eye permit such non-invasive visualization of the retina and associated pathology, the same optics induce significant aberrations that obviate cellular-resolution imaging in most cases. Adaptive optics (AO) imaging systems use active optical elements to compensate for aberrations in the optical path between the object and the camera. When applied to the human eye, AO allows direct visualization of individual rod and cone photoreceptor cells, retinal pigment epithelium cells, and white blood cells. AO imaging has changed the way vision scientists and ophthalmologists see the retina, helping to clarify our understanding of retinal structure, function, and the etiology of various retinal pathologies. Here, we review some of the advances that were made possible with AO imaging of the human retina and discuss applications and future prospects for clinical imaging.},

	volume = {17},
	issn = {1546-170X},
	abstract = {Progress in understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) has been hindered by our inability to observe cells and extracellular components associated with human coronary atherosclerosis in situ. The current standards for microstructural investigation, histology and electron microscopy are destructive and prone to artifacts. The highest-resolution intracoronary imaging modality, optical coherence tomography (OCT), has a resolution of {\textasciitilde}10 μm, which is too coarse for visualizing most cells. Here we report a new form of OCT, termed micro-optical coherence tomography (μOCT), whose resolution is improved by an order of magnitude. We show that μOCT images of cadaver coronary arteries provide clear pictures of cellular and subcellular features associated with atherogenesis, thrombosis and responses to interventional therapy. These results suggest that μOCT can complement existing diagnostic techniques for investigating atherosclerotic specimens, and that μOCT may eventually become a useful tool for cellular and subcellular characterization of the human coronary wall in vivo.},

	abstract = {Imaging with optical resolution through turbid media is a long sought-after goal with important applications in deep tissue imaging. Although extensively studied1, this goal was considered impractical until recently. Adaptive-optics techniques2,3, which can correct weak aberrations, are inadequate for turbid samples, where light is scattered to complex speckle patterns with a number of modes greatly exceeding the number of degrees of control4. This conception changed after the demonstration of coherent focusing through turbid media by wavefront-shaping, using spatial light modulators5,6,7. Here, we show that wavefront-shaping enables wide-field imaging through turbid layers with incoherent illumination, and imaging of occluded objects using light scattered from diffuse walls. In contrast to the recently introduced schemes for imaging through turbid media8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15, our technique does not require coherent sources8,9,10,11,12,13,14, interferometric detection10,11,12,13,14, raster-scanning8,9,10,14,15 or off-line reconstruction11,12,13,14,15.

Here, we demonstrate a novel method utilizing elastic scattering from disordered nanoparticles to achieve subdiffraction limited imaging. The measured far-field speckle fields can be used to reconstruct the subwavelength details of the target by time reversal, which allows full-field dynamic super-resolution imaging.

These seemingly random speckle patterns are point spread functions (PSFs) generated by light from point sources propagating through a strongly scattering medium. The spatial correlation of PSFs allows image recovery with deconvolution techniques, while the spectral decorrelation allows them to play the role of tunable spectral filters in the deconvolution process. Our demonstrations utilizing optical physics of strongly scattering media and computational imaging present a cost-effective approach for multispectral imaging with many advantages.},

Here, we describe a near-infrared fluorescence reporter probe whose activation by cathepsin K is shown in live osteoclast cells and in mouse models of development and osteoclast upregulation.

However, addition of speckle patterns on a complex amplitude basis provides no reduction of contrast.

abstract = {In complex media such as white paint and biological tissue, light encounters nanoscale refractive-index inhomogeneities that cause multiple scattering. Such scattering is usually seen as an impediment to focusing and imaging. However, scientists have recently used strongly scattering materials to focus, shape and compress waves by controlling the many degrees of freedom in the incident waves. This was first demonstrated in the acoustic and microwave domains using time reversal, and is now being performed in the optical realm using spatial light modulators to address the many thousands of spatial degrees of freedom of light. This approach is being used to investigate phenomena such as optical super-resolution and the time reversal of light, thus opening many new avenues for imaging and focusing in turbid media. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {In the field of biomedical optics, optical scattering has traditionally limited the range of imaging within tissue to a depth of one millimetre. A recently developed class of wavefront-shaping techniques now aims to overcome this limit and achieve diffraction-limited control of light beyond one centimetre. By manipulating the spatial profile of an optical field before it enters a scattering medium, it is possible to create a micrometre-scale focal spot deep within tissue. To successfully operate in vivo, these wavefront-shaping techniques typically require feedback from within the biological sample. This Review summarizes recently developed 'guidestar' mechanisms that provide feedback for intra-tissue focusing. Potential applications of guidestar-assisted focusing include optogenetic control over neurons, targeted photodynamic therapy and deep tissue imaging.},

abstract = {Studying the internal structure of complex samples with light is an important task but a difficult challenge due to light scattering. While the complex optical distortions induced by scattering can be effectively undone if the medium's scattering-matrix is known, this matrix generally cannot be retrieved without the presence of an invasive detector or guide-star at the target points of interest. To overcome this limitation, the current state-of-the-art approaches utilize focused ultrasound for generating acousto-optic guide-stars, in a variety of different techniques. Here, we introduce the acousto-optic transmission matrix (AOTM), which is an ultrasonically-encoded, spatially-resolved, optical scattering-matrix. The AOTM provides both a generalized framework to describe any acousto-optic based technique, and a tool for light control and focusing beyond the acoustic diffraction-limit inside complex samples. We experimentally demonstrate complex light control using the AOTM singular vectors, and utilize the AOTM framework to analyze the resolution limitation of acousto-optic guided focusing approaches.},

abstract = {The measurement of the Transmission Matrix (TM) of a scattering medium is of great interest for imaging. It can be acquired directly by interferometry using an internal reference wavefront. Unfortunately, internal reference fields are scattered by the medium which results in a speckle that makes the TM measurement heterogeneous across the output field of view. We demonstrate how to correct for this effect using the intrinsic properties of the TM. For thin scattering media, we exploit the memory effect of the medium and the reference speckle to create a corrected TM. For highly scattering media where the memory effect is negligible, we use complementary reference speckles to compose a new TM, not compromised by the speckled reference anymore. Using this correction, we demonstrate large field of view second harmonic generation imaging through thick biological media.},

Techniques that combine ultrasound and light as exemplified by ultrasound-assisted wavefront shaping have enabled fluorescence imaging through scattering media. However, the translation of these techniques into in vivo applications has been hindered by the lack of high-speed solutions to counter the fast speckle decorrelation of dynamic tissue. Here, we report an ultrasound-enabled optical imaging method that instead leverages the dynamic nature to perform imaging. The method utilizes the correlation between the dynamic speckle-encoded fluorescence and ultrasound-modulated light signal that originate from the same location within a sample. We image fluorescent targets with an improved resolution of ≤75 µm (versus a resolution of 1.3 mm with direct optical imaging) within a scattering medium with 17 ms decorrelation time.

In practice, the matrix is usually measured using an invasive detector or low-resolution acoustic guide stars. Here, we introduce a non-invasive and all-optical strategy based on linear fluorescence to reconstruct the transmission matrices, to and from a fluorescent object placed inside a scattering medium. It consists in demixing the incoherent patterns emitted by the object using low-rank factorizations and phase retrieval algorithms. We experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of this method through robust and selective focusing. Additionally, from the same measurements, it is possible to exploit memory effect correlations to image and reconstruct extended objects.

Conventional light-field microscopy provides a single-shot 3D fluorescence capture method with good light efficiency and fast speed, but suffers from low spatial resolution and significant image degradation due to scattering in deep layers of brain tissue. Here, we propose a new compressive light-field microscopy method to address both problems, offering a path toward measurement of individual neuron activity across large volumes of tissue. The technique relies on spatial and temporal sparsity of fluorescence signals, allowing one to identify and localize each neuron in a 3D volume, with scattering and aberration effects naturally included and without ever reconstructing a volume image.

This framework is combined with a novel constrained deconvolution approach that extracts estimates of neural activity from fluorescence traces, to create a spatiotemporal processing algorithm that requires minimal parameter tuning. We demonstrate the general applicability of our method by applying it to in vitro and in vivo multi-neuronal imaging data, whole-brain light-sheet imaging data, and dendritic imaging data.

	abstract = {A new variant ‘PMF’ of factor analysis is described. It is assumed that X is a matrix of observed data and σ is the known matrix of standard deviations of elements of X. Both X and σ are of dimensions n × m. The method solves the bilinear matrix problem X = GF + E where G is the unknown left hand factor matrix (scores) of dimensions n × p, F is the unknown right hand factor matrix (loadings) of dimensions p × m, and E is the matrix of residuals. The problem is solved in the weighted least squares sense: G and F are determined so that the Frobenius norm of E divided (element-by-element) by σ is minimized. Furthermore, the solution is constrained so that all the elements of G and F are required to be non-negative. It is shown that the solutions by PMF are usually different from any solutions produced by the customary factor analysis (FA, i.e. principal component analysis (PCA) followed by rotations). Usually PMF produces a better fit to the data than FA. Also, the result of PF is guaranteed to be non-negative, while the result of FA often cannot be rotated so that all negative entries would be eliminated. Different possible application areas of the new method are briefly discussed. In environmental data, the error estimates of data can be widely varying and non-negativity is often an essential feature of the underlying models. Thus it is concluded that PMF is better suited than FA or PCA in many environmental applications. Examples of successful applications of PMF are shown in companion papers.},

Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

abstract = {This paper presents a fast algorithm for restoring video sequences. The proposed algorithm, as opposed to existing methods, does not consider video restoration as a sequence of image restoration problems. Rather, it treats a video sequence as a space-time volume and poses a space-time total variation regularization to enhance the smoothness of the solution. The optimization problem is solved by transforming the original unconstrained minimization problem to an equivalent constrained minimization problem. An augmented Lagrangian method is used to handle the constraints, and an alternating direction method is used to iteratively find solutions to the subproblems. The proposed algorithm has a wide range of applications, including video deblurring and denoising, video disparity refinement, and hot-air turbulence effect reduction. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A new technique for the acceleration of iterative image restoration algorithms is proposed. The method is based on the principles of vector extrapolation and does not require the minimization of a cost function. The algorithm is derived and its performance illustrated with Richardson–Lucy (R–L) and maximum entropy (ME) deconvolution algorithms and the Gerchberg–Saxton magnitude and phase retrieval algorithms. Considerable reduction in restoration times is achieved with little image distortion or computational overhead per iteration. The speedup achieved is shown to increase with the number of iterations performed and is easily adapted to suit different algorithms. An example R–L restoration achieves an average speedup of 40 times after 250 iterations and an ME method 20 times after only 50 iterations. An expression for estimating the acceleration factor is derived and confirmed experimentally. Comparisons with other acceleration techniques in the literature reveal significant improvements in speed and stability.},

The effectiveness of the developed framework is tested using a case study that focuses on the role of the university within the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Chair program. Using correlation analysis, the activities and investment areas that lead to the desired outcomes for the university research are identified. By using the developed framework over time and applying it to different research programs and industries, key activities and investment areas can be established and improved R{\&}D policies and implementation plans developed.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a compact and easy-to-build computational camera for single-shot 3D imaging. Our lensless system consists solely of a diffuser placed in front of a standard image sensor. Every point within the volumetric field-of-view projects a unique pseudorandom pattern of caustics on the sensor. By using a physical approximation and simple calibration scheme, we solve the large-scale inverse problem in a computationally efficient way. The caustic patterns enable compressed sensing, which exploits sparsity in the sample to solve for more 3D voxels than pixels on the 2D sensor. Our 3D voxel grid is chosen to match the experimentally measured two-point optical resolution across the field-of-view, resulting in 100 million voxels being reconstructed from a single 1.3 megapixel image. However, the effective resolution varies significantly with scene content. Because this effect is common to a wide range of computational cameras, we provide new theory for analyzing resolution in such systems.},

	abstract = {Multidimensional scaling can be considered as involving three basic steps. In the first step, a scale of comparative distances between all pairs of stimuli is obtained. This scale is analogous to the scale of stimuli obtained in the traditional paired comparisons methods. In this scale, however, instead of locating each stimulus-object on a given continuum, the distances between each pair of stimuli are located on a distance continuum. As in paired comparisons, the procedures for obtaining a scale of comparative distances leave the true zero point undetermined. Hence, a comparative distance is not a distance in the usual sense of the term, but is a distance minus an unknown constant. The second step involves estimating this unknown constant. When the unknown constant is obtained, the comparative distances can be converted into absolute distances. In the third step, the dimensionality of the psychological space necessary to account for these absolute distances is determined, and the projections of stimuli on axes of this space are obtained. A set of analytical procedures was developed for each of the three steps given above, including a least-squares solution for obtaining comparative distances by the complete method of triads, two practical methods for estimating the additive constant, and an extension of Young and Householder's Euclidean model to include procedures for obtaining the projections of stimuli on axes from fallible absolute distances.},

But, finding the right shape for the wavefront is a challenge when the mapping between input and output scattered wavefronts (that is, the transmission matrix) is not known. Correlations in transmission matrices, especially the so-called memory effect, have been exploited to address this limitation. However, the traditional memory effect applies to thin scattering layers at a distance from the target, which precludes its use within thick scattering media, such as fog and biological tissue. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally verify new transmission matrix correlations within thick anisotropically scattering media, with important implications for biomedical imaging and adaptive optics.},
