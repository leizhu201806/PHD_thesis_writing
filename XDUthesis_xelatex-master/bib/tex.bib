abstract = {The optical memory effect has emerged as a powerful tool for imaging through multiple-scattering media; however, the finite angular range of the memory effect limits the field of view. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that selective coupling of incident light into a high-transmission channel increases the angular memory-effect range. This enhancement is attributed to the robustness of the high-transmission channels against perturbations such as sample tilt or wavefront tilt. Our work shows that the high-transmission channels provide an enhanced field of view for memory effect-based imaging through diffusive media.},

	abstract = {Optical imaging through and inside complex samples is a difficult challenge with important applications in many fields. The fundamental problem is that inhomogeneous samples such as biological tissue randomly scatter and diffuse light, preventing the formation of diffraction-limited images. Despite many recent advances, no current method can perform non-invasive imaging in real-time using diffused light. Here, we show that, owing to the ‘memory-effect’ for speckle correlations, a single high-resolution image of the scattered light, captured with a standard camera, encodes sufficient information to image through visually opaque layers and around corners with diffraction-limited resolution. We experimentally demonstrate single-shot imaging through scattering media and around corners using spatially incoherent light and various samples, from white paint to dynamic biological samples. Our single-shot lensless technique is simple, does not require wavefront-shaping nor time-gated or interferometric detection, and is realized here using a camera-phone. It has the potential to enable imaging in currently inaccessible scenarios.},
